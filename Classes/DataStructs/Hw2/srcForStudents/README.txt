Due to the constraints of the assignment, finding the maximum width of the Binary Tree was extremely difficult.
If we had had a depth method it would have been trivial, but were couldn't add one. I chose to use wrapper/helper
methods in order to achieve recursion and to maintain the required method signatures.

This assignment was very good practices debugging!
